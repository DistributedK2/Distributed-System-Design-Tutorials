In Multithreading, every thread is assigned a CPU time using context switching.
This is done in a way that seems the threads are executed in parallel but in fact 
concurrent programming is different from parallel programming.
Threads and Processes are two basic units of execution in concurrent programming.
Threads exist within a process. Every process has at least one thread running.
Every thread has a unique identifier. Classes implementing runnable interface do not have
unique identifier but the thread they use has an id.
Thread has several useful methods such as Thread.stop and Thread.start.
Thread.sleep forces the thread to wait for a specific period.
Interrupts are used to notify threads that they have to stop and do something else.
In order to keep the integrity of the data, we have to sometimes synchronize methods in threads. This can
be done using synchronized as in SynchronizedCounter class. Note that constructors cannot be
synchronized.
We can also use the lock interface to synchronize objects as below:
lock l = ...
l.lock();
try {
 	// access the resources protected by this lock
} finally {
	l.unlock();
}
