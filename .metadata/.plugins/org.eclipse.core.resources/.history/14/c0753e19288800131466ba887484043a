In Remote Method Invocation (RMI), an object in one program can invoke a method on a remote object running in another program. This is
similar to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) but it is extended to work on distributed objects. In Java, RMI provides remote communication
between programs in Java Virtual Machines across a distributed system.
