In Remote Method Invocation (RMI), an object running in one program can invoke a method on a remote object running in another program. This is
similar to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) but it is extended to work on distributed objects. In Java, RMI provides remote communication
between programs in Java Virtual Machines across a distributed system. 
The basic components of RMI are typically a client which invokes method on a remote object, a server on which the remote object is running
and a registry server which associates the remote objects with unique names. For RMI to work, both client and server have to implement the
same server object interface which defines the methods for the remote object running on the server.
