JAVA IDL provides CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) for distributed invocation
of methods between remote applications in a heterogeneous environment. Thus applications can
be implemented in a variety of platforms and programming languages. 
Each language has it's own mapping of the language-neutral Interface Definition Language (IDL) 
and so can communicate through it with other languages that also support IDL.
For interaction of objects in separate programs, IDL provides Object Request Broker (ORB).

After compiling IDLmap.idl we get the generated package IDLmap.
