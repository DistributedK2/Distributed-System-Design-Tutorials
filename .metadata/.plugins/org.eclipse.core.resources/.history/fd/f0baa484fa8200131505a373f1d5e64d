Computers in networks communicate through two ways TCP and UDP.
UDP (User Datagram Protocal) sends independent packets of data called datagrams from one
computer to another. It is an unreliable method of communication meaning that unlike TCP,
it is not a connection-based protocal. Ping command which is used to test the connectivity
of the network is an example of an application that uses UDP.
