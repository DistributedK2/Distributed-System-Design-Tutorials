In Remote Method Invocation (RMI), an object in one process can invoke a method on a remote object in another process. This is
simillar to Rewmote Procedure Call (RPC) but it is extended to work on distributed objects. In Java, RMI provides remote communication
between Java Virtual Machines across a distributed system.
